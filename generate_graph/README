The script in this folder generates the trimming graph of quadratic APN functions. In order to run it, you first need an up-to-date version of sboxU (i.e. with a commit at least as recent as c712ee837d5d92f039609ff4eb5ed13167c6cef8). You need to place the sboxU folder in the current directory (or a link to it).

Note that sboxU requires a recent version of SAGE. This code was only tested with version 9.3.

You also need to have the `dot` tool, which is contained in the `dot` package in the usual ubuntu repositories (it should work on windows but we could not test it).

Then, to generate the trimming graph of quadratic APN functions, simply run the following commands:

    sage cczTrunc.py > graph.gv
    dot graph.gv -Tpng > picture.png


/!\ Adding new 8-bit functions /!\

If you want to run this code yourself on a bigger set of 8-bit S-box, be careful! The APN trims are sorted into distinct CCZ equivalence classes using the differential and linear properties of their ortho-derivatives. However, these quantities are the same for x^3 and x^9 when n=7, meaning that APN trims in the CCZ-class of either of these mappings we be considered as belonging to the same class. It is not a problem for us since neither mapping in the trimmings of a known 8-bit function, but caution may still be needed.
