The script in this folder generates the trimming graph of quadratic APN functions. In order to run it, you first need an up-to-date version of sboxU (i.e. with a commit at least as recent as c712ee837d5d92f039609ff4eb5ed13167c6cef8). You need to place the sboxU folder in the current directory (or a link to it).

Note that sboxU requires a recent version of SAGE. This code was only tested with version 9.3.

You also need to have the `dot` tool, which is contained in the `dot` package in the usual ubuntu repositories (it should work on windows but we could not test it).

Then, to generate the trimming graph of quadratic APN functions, simply run the following commands:

    sage cczTrunc.py > graph.gv
    dot graph.gv -Tpng > picture.png
